<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">When printing tables in proportional pitch the problem is, how to keep
the columns correctly aligned.
In the PRINT operation control lines having a 'T' in the control column
serve this purpose. A 'T' line must have other 'T's to indicate the
columns (tab positions) which should be aligned in the final output.
After encountering a 'T' line PRINT will align all subsequent lines
according to it. To supress the effect of the 'T' line for the remain-
ing lines, an empty 'T' line (with no 'T's except in the control column)
must be used.
Any 'T' on 'T' line indicates the text to be aligned to the right and
parentheses () indicate alignment to the left from ')'.
To change the tabular alignment, a new 'T' line should be included
and to supress tabulating temporarily, 'U' should be used in the control
column. For example:
 11 T   T          (     )    ( )  T
 12 *   January    1000.45    112  good
 13 *   February    987.87     55  poor
 14 U This line will be printed without alignment.
 15 *   March      1245.09     65  satisfactory
 16 T Here is a line (without capital t) terminating alignment.
 17 * Lines 12,13 and 15 will be correctly aligned according to 11.

The gaps between the columns indicated by 'T's and parentheses on the
'T' line are selected according to the current font size.
The default gap is 60% of the font size in points.
This often leads to gaps which are too wide for numeric tables,
for example. In such cases the gap may be changed by entering
the 'T' line in the form
    T    *8    T     (      )     (   )   T
where the number (8) after '*' indicates the new gap in points.
