<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">PREFIX F7 turns on/off the sound effects defined in the SOUND.BIN
file in the &lt;Survo&gt;\U\SYS directory. (Not yet available in SURVO MM!)
SOUND.BIN is a binary file of 256 characters. It can be edited by the
CODES LOAD and CODES SAVE operations.
For each printable character, the SOUND.BIN file gives a value 0 - 255
which is the pitch of that character on a twelve-tone scale.
When the cursor is moved either up or down, each character touched will
generate the tone defined in SOUND.BIN .
The value for standard pitch ( a = 440 hz) is given as the second byte
in SOUND.BIN. Default is 65.
The first byte in SOUND.BIN is the duration of each sound.
In the default setting of SOUND.BIN, the letters give the chromatic
scale starting from A,a=440 hz and digits 0,1,2,3,... ascending C major
triad tones. This simplifies detecting of outliers in numerical columns.
Moving over field borders in horizontal direction gives same tones as
the digits 0,1,2,3,... in vertical direction.
Any column in the FILE SHOW display can also be "played" automatically
by turning the sound on (by PREFIX F7) and starting by PREFIX (DOWN) .
The tempo can be adjusted during the play by the '+' and '-' keys.
The original tempo is given as the third byte in SOUND.BIN .
