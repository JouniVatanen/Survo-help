<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">Technical structure of SURVO MM 

SURVO MM is written in the C language using WIN32 API library functions.
It works in Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, Me, and XP, 7 and 8 environments.
SURVO MM consists of a family of program modules. The main module
is the SURVO MM editor which calls other modules as child processes
when needed (according to the user's actions). The user has no need to
know the internal structure of the system.

SURVO MM has been created directly by using the source code of the
earlier version SURVO 98 as the basis. In typical statistical modules,
for examples, only slight changes are needed. On the contrary,
all routines handling the keyboard, screen and mouse have been rewritten
using WIN32 functions.

The current number of SURVO MM modules (EXE files) is about 100.
Typically one module contains the program code of several SURVO MM commands
and operations. Furtheremore there are about 700 other system
files like sucros (Survo macros), files of the help system, drivers, <STRONG>e</STRONG>tc.
