<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">Examples in the Help system of SURVO MM: (Not available in the Web Edition)
The Help system contains also examples about Survo usage. In older
versions the user had to load them into the current edit field in order
to see how they work.
Now it is possible to activate examples directly from the Help system.
When a 'button' |EXAMPLE| appears in the Help window, a demo related
to the current subject will be activated by double-clicking this button.
In fact, another copy of SURVO MM will then carry out this task by using
the sucro automatically. When the example is terminated, the user must
exit this second Survo and then he/she will be back in the original
Survo session.
This option highly improves learning Survo usage.

As a long-term goal we are going to extend the help system to cover
"all" activities with illustrative EXAMPLE's, but this requires
a lot of work. However, already now there are plenty of demo sucros
related to the examples of the Survo book (1992); most of them
will be connected to the Help system in the nearest future.
Currently EXAMPLE's can be found in about 40 places and they can be
found systematically, for example, by activating
/HSEARCH |EXAMPLE|
Various EXAMPLE's:
COUNT?       4 examples of various forms of the COUNT command
FORM?        Example on page 36 of the Survo book
PLOT?:1,X,G  New GROUPING specification in bar charts
MOUSE2?      Use of the mouse when positioning texts in screen graphics
CORRESP?     (Old) example related to correspondence analysis
