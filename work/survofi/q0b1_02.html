<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">TIME
gives the date and time in the form
TIME Sun Dec 29 17:51:17 1985
on the current (TIME) line. TIME is useful in time measurement for long
sequences of Survo operations activated by PREFIX ESC.

Sucro /TDIFF (without parameters) gives the difference of two preceding
TIME results in seconds.

TIME COUNT START (without parameters) resets a clock to 0.000 seconds.
TIME COUNT END   (without parameters) gives the time elapsed since the
last activation of TIME COUNT START.


<A NAME="TIMES"></A>For measuring execution times of various Survo operations
in series of activations (e.g. in sucros) the following form
of TIME COUNT is useful.

TIME COUNT FILE &lt;pathname_of_a_text_file&gt; 
opens a new text file for saving execution times.
When an operation has been activated and completed, the time elapsed
is saved in the text file as a new line in the form
&lt;name_of_command&gt; &lt;execution_time_in_seconds&gt; 
Example: MNSIMUL 4.840
         --- 2.010
         CORR 1.230

Times between activations (typing text and commands, moving the cursor,
etc.) are indicated in the file by '--- commands'.
Before studying and analyzing the contents of the text file it must be
closed by the command
TIME COUNT FILE CLOSE
