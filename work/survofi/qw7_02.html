<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText"><STRONG>Introduction</STRONG> 

With the MFEDIT operation you may display and edit several SURVO 84C
data files at a time. The condition for the operation is that there
must be a relation between those data files. The relation is
indicated by key variables.
 In the MFEDIT operation, information is displayed, edited and entered
on forms in the same way as in the FEDIT operation. In MFEDIT each
form may be divided into subforms. Different files may be assigned to
subforms. The size of a form is not limited to the size of the
screen. For instance, one may design a form which has 120 rows and
100 columns.
 Further, the user may have a set of forms which are displayed one at
a time. When new values are entered, MFEDIT automatically checks that
the values are not in contradiction with the type of the field.
Additional validity checks may be defined, e.g. by listing valid
values for some fields.

The form of the MFEDIT operation is

MFEDIT &lt;form file&gt; 
FILE1=&lt;Survo data file&gt;(&lt;list of keys&gt;)
FILE2=&lt;Survo data file&gt;(&lt;list of keys&gt;)
...
&lt;options&gt; 

THE FORM FILE
The forms are defined by a separate ASCII file. Their maximum record
length is 253 characters. Each form may be divided into subforms.
Usually, each Survo data file has its one subform and within one
subform, only variables of one data file are referred to. You can use
the SURVO 84C editor to create and edit it (unlike FEDIT, MFEDIT
cannot create a default form file).

SURVO DATA FILES
Survo data files must be given in the order defined by their hie-
rarchy (if such exists). All data files must exist; MFEDIT cannot
create them. After the name of the data file the keys defining the
relation between files are given in parentheses in such an order
that the primary keys are given first.

By default, the program expects that the corresponding keys have the
same names in different files; otherwise the correspondency must be
given. If that is not the case, then the correspondency is defined
by giving both names separated by a vertical bar in either of the
files (the name existing in that file must be given first), e.g.

MFEDIT federat.txt
FILE1=Society(Scode<STRONG>|Society</STRONG>)
FILE2=Persons(Personid)
FILE3=Members(Society,Personid)
Up to 7 assignments can be given to MFEDIT by the FILEn specifica-
tions. Each assignment may refer to different files or some of them
may refer to the same file. Up to 10 different key variables can
exist in these assignments.

By default, the program assumes that last file (given by FILE3 in the
example) is of primary interest, here named as a target file. During
the session, the target file can be changed by pressing the F4 key.

OPTIONS
With various options the user may specify the order in which the
observations are shown, the preliminary work of the program, the size
of the forms and some other limits of the program. One can also de-
fine that lowercase letters should be changed to capital letters.
<STRONG>Fields on forms</STRONG> 

Like FEDIT there are two kind of fields that may exist on forms:
  <STRONG>(1) standard fields</STRONG> and
  <STRONG>(2)</STRONG> <STRONG>selection fields</STRONG>.
