<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">LOADP &lt;text file&gt; 
loads all the contents of &lt;text file&gt; in the edit field from the
next line onwards. See also <A HREF="q04_06.html">SHOW</A>.

If the text file is created by another Windows program,
LOADW command is to be used instead of LOADP.
LOADW has the same options and it makes the code conversions automatically.

If the text file is created by a Linux program,
LOADU command is to be used instead of LOADP.

LOADP, LOADW, LOADU commands may overwrite current text in the edit
field.
For automatic insertion of empty lines in order to avoid overwriting
the new SHOWLOAD mode of the SHOW command should be used.
SHOWLOAD?


LOADP &lt;text file&gt;,L
loads all the contents of &lt;text file&gt; in the edit field from
line L onwards.
LOADP &lt;text file&gt;,J1,J2,L
loads lines J1-J2 of &lt;text file&gt; in the edit field from line L onwards.

In all forms of LOADP specification USE can be employed for indicating
edit lines which are permitted for writing. For example, USE=*+
allows edit lines with '*' or '+' in the control column to be over-
written but lines with other control characters are skipped.
Similarly, (if USE is not given) SKIP can be used for assigning edit
lines which must be skipped when lines from the text file are written.
For example, SKIP=-&amp; implies lines with '-' or '&amp;' in the control column
to be left intact.
If both USE and SKIP are missing, all edit lines are writable.

USE and SKIP are helpful when text and tables are loaded to fill a ready-
made PRINT list which has control lines between the text lines.

If too long lines (with respect to current edit line length) occur,
the process will be interrupted and the first line exceeding the maximal
length is displayed with an error message.
In such cases a SPLIT specification may be used. SPLIT=1 divides long
lines into suitable parts. SPLIT=- also puts a `-' after `hyphenated
words'.
SPLIT=SP,&lt;width&gt; 
divides long lines when possible by not breaking contiguous strings
(words) using line width &lt;width&gt;.  By default &lt;width&gt; is the current
width of the Survo main window.
LOADW CLIPBOARD / SPLIT=SP
loads the current text in the Windows clipboard.
