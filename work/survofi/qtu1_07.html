<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">To make the sucros more general, various enhancements may be added
by using TUTLOAD and TUTSAVE operations.
TUTLOAD &lt;sucro file&gt; 
loads the sucro program from &lt;sucro file&gt; in the edit field below
the current line. The printable characters appear in that listing as
such, but the non-printable characters (like those corresponding to
various moves of the cursor, RETURN, arrow keys, HOME etc.) are coded
as special words given in braces. Thus HOME is {home} and RETURN (ENTER)
is {R}, for example.
When comparing to the description of the sucro code in the User's Guide
(1987), the notation style has been completely revised in order to make
sucro programs more readable. Nothing has been changed in the structure
and contents of .TUT files of the older Survo versions.

The code represented in the edit field can be edited freely by using the
normal editorial functions. After editing, the code is saved back to a
sucro file by editing TUTLOAD &lt;file&gt; to TUTSAVE &lt;file&gt; and by activating it.
When editing sucros, various special codes may be added.

To spare disk space, related sucros can be saved in one .TUT file.
Assume that the common file name should be ABCD.TUT . Then any
sucro, say XYZ, written in the edit field is saved in this file by
the command TUTSAVE ABCD-XYZ and loaded back to the edit field by the
command TUTLOAD ABCD-XYZ . It can also be deleted from the file by
TUTDEL ABCD-XYZ .
To see the names of sucros saved in ABCD.TUT, use the command
TUTLOAD ABCD .
Warning: Never activate TUTSAVE ABCD since it destroys the true contents
of the ABCD.TUT file.

Sucros in ABCD.TUT are called by their complete names, i.e. by commands like
/ABCD-XYZ

Sucros belonging to the same sucro family (file), say ABCD, can call
each other by commands of the form {load *-PART2} or {call *-PART2}
where * is now interpreted as ABCD. This makes possible to alter the
family name (here ABCD) without making any changes in the members.

Instead of loading sucro program text into the edit field, it can be
written in a text file by the command
TUTLOAD &lt;sucro_file&gt;,&lt;text_file&gt; .
The current Survo data path is default for the text file.
