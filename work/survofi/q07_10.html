<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">Without precaution, results of Survo operations may overlap other
operations or important text in the edit field. Such nuisances
are avoided by using fence lines of form
*########## (# and at least 10 dots) and activating commands with
a '#' in front of the command word.
If the #'s cover the visible line, the fence line is displayed
as a continuous single line.

A simple and safe way of creating a fence structure for a command
is to press F1 # when the cursor is in the first position of the command
line and the command starts from that position.

By default, the current edit field is saved as #SURVO.EDT in the current
data path when a #command is activated. Then the status before
activation is restored afterwards simply by activating LOAD #SURVO.
This precaution is removed by setting the system parameter fence_save=0.
If the fence structure is incorrect (fence line missing), an error
message is displayed. This setting is removed by setting fence_warning=0.
Results obtained by #commands can be removed from lines L1-L2 by
DELETEL L1,L2,FENCE

Example:
*#MINSTAT DECA,CUR+1 / VARS=Height,Weight
*##########
*Important text follows....
*
*When the #MINSTAT command above is activated, the results will be
*inserted between the command line and the following fence line:
*
*#MINSTAT DECA,CUR+1 / VARS=Height,Weight
*Basic statistics of data DECA N=48
*Variable   mean      stddev          N  minimum   maximum
* Height    186.9583  5.090493       48  173.0000  198.0000
* Weight    85.56250  6.847600       48  68.00000  105.0000
*##########
*Important text follows....
