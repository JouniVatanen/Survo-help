<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">/SCATPLOT &lt;data&gt;                                         / K.Vehkalahti
creates a scatterplot matrix of active variables in the data set &lt;data&gt;.
The graphical view consists of ordinary scatter diagrams (see <A HREF="q12_01.html">SCAT</A>?)
which are plotted in their own windows (see <A HREF="q111_02.html">GPLOT</A>?). The windows are
organized by a special layout file which is created dynamically based on
the number of active variables. Each scatter diagram window can be freely
moved, resized, minimized, maximized, and even deleted by using the mouse.

By clicking the EXIT button of the graphical view, all windows are deleted,
and the control returns to the edit field. The sucro gives the user a ready
made work field, where various specifications can be modified, and the
pictures then easily re-produced by one sucro command.

All specifications of scatter diagrams may be used in the work field, and
many of them may be given even beforehand when the sucro is started, namely
POINT, TREND, CONTOUR, XDIV, YDIV, SIZE, MODE, PEN, and LINETYPE.
The sucro then brings these into the GLOBAL part of the work field.
The default setting follows the defaults of the scatter diagrams.

                               Additional specifications on the next page!

Additional specifications of /SCATPLOT:

JITTER=k
   Discrete variables (with at most k distinct values) are randomized
   uniformly around the true values within a total interval (jitter step) of
   (max-min)/(h-1) where h is the number of distinct values. This option is
   exactly the same as in the draftsman's display (see <A HREF="q1d_03.html">DRAFTS</A>?). The actual
   jitter steps are found by the MINSTAT operation (see <A HREF="q29_06.html">MINSTAT</A>?), and the
   plotting is achieved by using the XJITTER and YJITTER specifications of
   GPLOT (see <A HREF="q12_08.html">XJITTER</A>?).

LOWESS=&lt;smooth_level&gt; 
   A LOcally WEighted Scatterplot Smooth (see <A HREF="qjp1_01.html">LOWESS</A>?) is added to each
   graph with the given &lt;smooth_level&gt;. The value 1 corresponds to the
   default value of LOWESS operation.

SHOW=0
   By SHOW=0 the work field is created but the graphs are not automatically
   plotted. (By default SHOW=1 is used.)
