<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">A command or operation is activated either by a double-click of the mouse or
by moving the cursor to the command line and by pressing key ESC.

Please note that a double-click of the RIGHTmost mouse button leads
to the help system (showing information about the word indicated by the mouse).

Continuous activation:
To carry out a series of consecutive operations (run mode), press first
F2:PREFIX and then ESC. Such a series must not contain sucro commands.

In Survo operations, lines of the edit field are referred to by
their indices (1,2,3,...) or by their labels. A label is a single
character (like A,X,a,x) placed in the control column. Also END
(END+3, END-5) are possible line labels, END indicating the last non-
empty line in the field. Similarly CUR refers to the current line
indicated by the cursor.
Thus CUR, CUR+5, A, A-5 are permitted line labels.
Example:
PRINT CUR+1,END  /  Print lines below the current line.

To specify columns in Survo operations, the column indices are not
used in general. The columns are indicated by various masks
(images, patterns) on image lines. For instance, image line in
numerical sort (see <A HREF="q0b_02.html">SORT</A>) has the structure "    12345     "
where the location of the mask 12345 corresponds to the sort key
column.
In statistical operations, the data sets to be analyzed may be located
either in the edit field or in special data files and they are referred
to by their names given usually by a DATA definition.
