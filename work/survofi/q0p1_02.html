<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">Survo supports PostScript printers in all forms of PRINT, PLOT and
HISTO operations. The interface in Survo enables all the features
provided by PostScript language to be employed in applications.
The user has no need to master the PostScript language, since all the
functions and specifications related to printing and plotting have been
converted to common notations used in Survo.
However, in very demanding applications familiarity with PostScript
programming may be useful.
The standard device driver is PS.DEV in the &lt;Survo&gt;\U\SYS directory.

In PLOT and HISTO operations, a DEVICE specification of the form
DEVICE=PS   (immediate plotting)
or
DEVICE=PS,&lt;filename.PS&gt;  (making a PostScript file)
must be supplied. The default driver is PS.DEV but it can be changed
by giving in SURVO.APU ps_dev=&lt;filename.DEV&gt;.
In PRINT operations, either
  - include PS.DEV
should be given as the first line in the print list or
the default driver has to be given in the SURVO.APU file in the
form print_dev=PS.DEV .

Complete documents are usually generated by a large PRINT scheme
containing references to text chapters located in edit files and
text files. Pictures made by PLOT operations and saved as PostScript
files are included in those documents by - picture control lines.
Text and pictures can be rescaled and rotated in the final output.
The entire document produced by PRINT can be saved in a PostScript
file, too (by PRINT L1,L2 TO &lt;file.PS&gt;).

Since PostScript files are device-independent, the user can make drafts
of the documents on small laser printers. After these test printouts the
final document may be produced on a high-quality typesetter on the basis
of the same PostScript file.
