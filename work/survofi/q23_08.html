<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">Matrix files generated by various statistical operations as inter-
mediate results (typically with extension .M) can be used as input
data in all operations working with statistical data sets. Then
the columns are considered variables and rows cases (observations).
In addition, the row labels correspond to a string variable (CASE)
appearing as #1 among variables. The actual columns of the matrix
are numerical (double precision) variables with indices 2,3,...
and their names are the column labels. By default, the CASE variable
is passive but the other variables are active (activated by 'A').
Use names of variables or VARS,MASK specifications for other selections.

Exception:
Matrix files of symmetric and diagonal matrices are nor accepted as
data files since a normal data set (table) is not "symmetric".
In special cases where a symmetric matrix should be used as a data
matrix it is easy to convert it to a Survo data file by
FILE SAVE MAT command. For example, the correlation matrix CORR.M
(produced by CORR) is converted to a Survo data file D_CORR by
FILE SAVE MAT CORR.M TO D_CORR

If a matrix file is used as a data set, it must be referred to by
the complete pathname with the extension (.M or .MAT).

For example, the two first factors (F1,F2) of a factor matrix FACT.M
created as a result of the FACTA operation can be plotted on the
screen by the PLOT scheme:
GPLOT FACT.M,F1,F2
SCALE=-1,0,1 GRID=XY POINT=CASE
LINE=6 LINE2=0,0 (Points are to be connected to the origin)

To make a MVBAR chart of the same factors with CASE indicating each
pair of bars, use the following scheme:
GPLOT FACT.M   / TYPE=MVBAR MASK=AAA (The first 'A' indicates CASE)
