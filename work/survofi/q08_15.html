<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">Control words in brackets given on control lines of PRINT lists:

[line_spacing(x)]
selects a line spacing of x Points (x/72 inches). Default is 12.
[page_length(x)]
selects a page length of x Points. Default is 780 (suitable for A4 paper).
[left_margin(x)]
sets the left margin to x  picas (x/12 inches). Default is 18.
[margin(x)]
sets the left margin to x  dmm (10 dmm = 1 mm).
[COPIES(x)]
sets the number of copies of each page to x. Default is 1.
[LANDSCAPE]
rotates the A4 page 90 degrees and the next lines will be printed from the top
of the rotated page using the current left margin. The page length is not
changed automatically, but it can be reselected separately by
[page_length(528)], for example.
[PORTRAIT]
restores the original orientation of the page and the next lines will be printed
from the top line onwards.

Control words in PRINT lists (continued):

[STORE(x)]
saves the current printing position as a point with a label x. This x can be any
word. Example: [STORE(start)].
[JUMP(x)]
restores the printing position saved by [STORE(x)].
[POINT(x,y)]
takes a new printing position with coordinates x,y given in dmm units. The
origin is the bottom left corner of the page. The left margin is not changed, bu
it can be redefined when necessary with [margin(x)] where x is given in
dmm, too.
[COUNT_OFF]
breaks counting of lines and thus prevents an automatic page change.
[COUNT_ON]
continues line counting from the situation before the last [COUNT_OFF].
Control words [COUNT_ON] and [COUNT_OFF] are useful in printing text in
several columns, for example.
[PRINT_OFF]
Lines after this control code are skipped in printing until code
[PRINT_ON] is encountered and printing continues.

Control words in PRINT lists (continued):

[GRAY(x)]
sets value 0&lt;x&lt;1 (from black to white) for the grayness of the background
of the text when using the default shadow 5.
[FOREBACK(x,y)]
defines both the grayness of text (x) and its background (y).
This option is used by selecting a shadow character, say I, by
 - shadow I: [FOREBACK(1,0)] [NORMAL]
In this case I is the same as the default shadow 7 [REVERSE].

[FONT_SCALING(x,y)]
rescales the current font by multiplying the width by x and the height by y.
