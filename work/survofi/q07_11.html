<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">SPECS specification
The specifications locating on the current command line, say cur, have
the highest priority. From SURVO MM ver.3.26 this line can be 'extended'
by giving a SPECS specification on the command line. It has the
form SPECS=A,B and this implies that specifications on edit lines A-B
are scanned for specifications immediately after specifications on
the command line. SPECS can also be given in the form SPECS=A
implying that lines either lines A - cur-1 (when A&lt;cur) or
cur+1 - A (when A&gt;cur) are extensions of the command line cur.

The SPECS specification gives more possibilities for making applications
with multiple activations with common and individual specifications
according to the needs of the application.

Due to the modular structure of SURVO MM, this new SPECS option will
be not be working in all Survo operations.
A list of operations working currently with SPECS is on the next page.

Operations working currently with SPECS:
All plotting operations (PLOT,GPLOT,GHISTO),
CORR, STAT, MINSTAT, LINREG, REGDIAG, ESTIMATE, MAT
