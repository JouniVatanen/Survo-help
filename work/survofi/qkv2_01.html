<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">SEARCH &lt;words&gt;                                               / K.Vehkalahti
searches the given &lt;words&gt; from text files and edit files. The default
behaviour can be modified by various specifications, which are described
on the following pages.

By default
  - all files (*.*) from the current path are scanned
  - actual search is aimed at text files and Survo edit field files
  - only the first match on a line counts
  - matching is case sensitive, i.e. uppercase and lowercase are not same
  - search is paused after every match unless ESC is pressed
  - SHOW commands with the filename and the line number are written
    in the edit field starting at line CUR+1.

There is another desktop operation (see <A HREF="qkv1_03.html">WHERE</A>?), which searches the
given file(s) by their name.


Specifications of SEARCH are:

  <B>FILES</B>=&lt;filespec&gt;   Only files matching &lt;filespec&gt; are scanned.
                     Examples: FILES=*.EDT  FILES=D:\WRK\JOB*.TXT
                     FILES=C:\PROJECTS\2003\*.EDT,D:\WRK\JOB*.TXT,E:\*.*

  <B>SEARCH</B>=&lt;rules&gt;     Modifies the search in various ways. &lt;rules&gt; may be
                     any combination of following: (separated by commas)
                      SUBDIRS -&gt; scan also the subdirectories
                     DETAILED -&gt; show all occurrences on a line
                       NOCASE -&gt; case independent search: abc = ABC
                       QUOTED -&gt; trailing spaces are taken into account:
                                 the character string must be given in
                                 quotation marks, e.g. SEARCH " abc XYZ "
                        FIRST -&gt; exit straight after first match
                         FILE -&gt; display only the first match of each file
                           DD -&gt; start DD with the files that matched
                      COMMENT -&gt; search from the comment line (1) of edit files
                      SHADOWS -&gt; search from shadow lines of edit files


Specifications of SEARCH (continued):

  <B>OUTFILE</B>=&lt;filespec&gt; Output is written to &lt;filespec&gt;. In this case
                     nothing is written to the edit field.

  <B>SHOW</B>=&lt;x&gt;           &lt;x&gt;=0 : no SHOW commands in the output.
                     &lt;x&gt;=1 : SHOW commands in the output (default).
                     &lt;x&gt;=2 : adds pathname to SHOW commands (default,
                             if SEARCH=SUBDIRS or FILES includes pathname).
                     &lt;x&gt;=3 : same than &lt;x&gt;=1 above, but writes the SHOW
                             commands and comments on distinct lines.
                             (See sucro /SEARCH which uses this feature!)
                     &lt;x&gt;=4 : same than &lt;x&gt;=3, but with full pathnames.
                             (See sucro /HSEARCH which uses this feature!)
                     &lt;x&gt;=5 : writes the results with the appropriate shadows
                             when SEARCH=SHADOWS is used.
                     &lt;x&gt;=6 : same than &lt;x&gt;=5, but with full pathnames.


Specifications of SEARCH (continued):

  <B>RUN</B>=1              Search begins immediately in continuous mode.

  <B>COLS</B>=C1,C2         Search is restricted to columns C1-C2. Default value
                     of C2 is C1. C1=0 means the control column in Survo
                     edit files and the first column in text files.

  <B>TUTSTACK</B>=1         The following facts are written to the sucro memory:
                       - the total number of strings found (W1),
                       - the number of files scanned (W2),
                       - the number of lines read (W3).


Exit SEARCH anytime by pressing either F8 (EXIT) or `.' (full stop).
ESC toggles between continuous and stepwise search.
By pressing `S' the current file can be skipped.


Specifications of SEARCH (continued):

 <B>DATE</B>=&lt;format&gt;    Selects a date format. Valid formats are:
                  DD.MM.YY   DD/MM/YY   DDMMYY   YYMMDD   MM/DD/YY
                  DD.MM.YYYY DD/MM/YYYY DDMMYYYY YYYYMMDD MM/DD/YYYY
                  (DD=day, MM=month, YY(YY)=year). Default is DD.MM.YY .

 <B>TIME</B>=&lt;format&gt;    Selects a time format. Valid formats are:
                  HH:MM  HH:MM:SS  HH.MM  HH.MM.SS
                  (HH=hour, MM=minute, SS=second). Default is HH:MM .

The specifications <B>SINCE</B>, <B>BEFORE</B>, <B>MINBYTES</B> and <B>MAXBYTES</B> (see: <A HREF="qkv1_02.html">DD</A>?) can also
be used with SEARCH.
