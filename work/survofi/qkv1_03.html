<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">WHERE &lt;filespec&gt;                                             / K.Vehkalahti
searches files from the disk(s) by their name. By default the found files
are presented as a file list in another desktop operation, DD (see <A HREF="qkv1_02.html">DD</A>?).
The default behaviour can be modified by various specifications, which are
described on the following pages.

The &lt;filespec&gt; can contain several disks and wildcards in the filename.
If any disk(s) without directories are given, the search starts from the
root directory of each disk:
    WHERE CDE:*.TMP

If the disk(s) are omitted (giving nothing but the filename), only the
current directory tree is searched:
    WHERE *.EDT

Scanning of the files is interrupted by pressing '.' (full stop).
WHERE can also be used from DD by the Where key (W).

There is another desktop operation (see <A HREF="q04_16.html">SEARCH</A>?), which searches the
given words <STRONG>inside</STRONG> the files.

Specifications of WHERE:

  <B>WHERE</B>=&lt;rules&gt;      Modifies the search in various ways. &lt;rules&gt; may be
                     any combination of following: (separated by commas)
                      SUBDIRS -&gt; scan also the subdirectories [1]
                        FIRST -&gt; exit straight after first match
                                 (Use of TUTSTACK specification (see <A HREF="qkv1_02.html">DD</A>?)
                                 may be useful, see also sucro PS-PDF)
                           DD -&gt; start DD with the files that matched [1]
                              [1]: (default behaviour, c.f. SEARCH)

  <B>OUTFILE</B>=&lt;file&gt;     The full pathnames of the found files are written into 
                     the given file, which is erased. 

The specifications <B>SINCE</B>, <B>BEFORE</B>, <B>MINBYTES</B> and <B>MAXBYTES</B> (see: <A HREF="qkv1_02.html">DD</A>?) can also
be used with WHERE, as well as any other specifications of DD.
