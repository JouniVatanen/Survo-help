<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">FILE SELECT &lt;new_data&gt; FROM &lt;old_data&gt; BY &lt;select_file&gt; 
            with a specification KEYS=&lt;var1&gt;,&lt;var2&gt;,...
makes a &lt;new_data&gt; file by copying observations from the &lt;old_data&gt; file
selectively.
The observations to be copied are determined by &lt;select_file&gt; which also
is a Survo data file.
Only those observations which have same values in variables indicated by
the KEYS specification in &lt;old_data&gt; and &lt;select_file&gt; are copied to
&lt;new_data&gt;.

Options:
The cases that are copied from &lt;old_data&gt; can be marked in a variable
given by a MARK=&lt;name_of_variable_in_old_data&gt; specification.
The MARK variable must be created before FILE SELECT (and intialized
with 0 values). FILE SELECT then gives the value 1 for the MARK variable
in those cases which are copied.
By a specification NMATCH=&lt;name_of_variable_in_select_file&gt; the number
of cases matched by each key combination is counted and saved.
Also the NMATCH variable must exist before FILE SELECT (and initialized
with 0 values).

FILE SELECT is much faster than FILE COPY in applications where a subset
of cases is to be selected from a huge data file according to certain
identification keys.

A complementary selection of observations can be made by using a
KEYS!=&lt;var1&gt;,&lt;var2&gt;,... specification. Then cases which differ at least
in one of the key variables are selected.
