<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">The current edit field can be always saved in an edit file by a
SAVE &lt;name of edit file&gt; operation which normally is located on
the first line of the edit field.
Any edit file formed in this way may be loaded back to the edit
field by a LOAD &lt;name of edit file&gt; operation and the former contents
of the edit field will then be lost. To load parts of edit files
on the empty lines of the edit field without spoiling the current
situation, use a SHOW &lt;name of edit file&gt; operation.

Edit files are almost like text files, but with a rigid structure
(constant line length) and lines saved without cr,lf ending.
An edit file name has the default extension .EDT.

An edit file can be converted to a text file by first loading it to
the edit field and then saving it using COPY L1,L2 TO &lt;text file&gt; 
where L1-L2 are the edit lines to be saved. Observe that COPY
appends lines L1-L2 to the end of &lt;text file&gt;.
To copy in the opposite direction from a text file to the edit field,
use the SHOW &lt;text file&gt; operation which enables scrolling of the
text file in a temporary window and loading of any lines from it.

Data sets typed in the edit field can be saved in Survo data files
first by saving the edit field in a text file (by COPY for example)
and the by using the FILE SAVE &lt;text_file&gt;,&lt;Survo_data_file&gt; 
operation.
For data lists and tables with a DATA header, a straighforward method
for this task is the FILE COPY operation:
FILE COPY &lt;data_list_or_table&gt;,&lt;Survo_data_file&gt; 

Survo provides various additional formats for files of sucros, matrices,
results, etc.
