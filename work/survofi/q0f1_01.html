  Freeware version Survo Editor 

Survo Editor covers about a half of SURVO MM functions.
The capacity of data files in Survo Editor is reduced.
There are no limitations for files with one, two, or three variables.
For number of variables m=4,5,...,15 the largest permitted number of
observations (cases) is 7500/m.
Thus when m is 15, the maximum amount of cases is 500.
Data files with more than 15 variables cannot be used in Survo Editor.
(In the complete SURVO MM version there are practically no such bounds
 at all.)

Survo Editor has no other restrictions in dimensions.
For example, sizes of the edit field and matrix files are not limited.



Survo Editor includes e.g. the following functions:

Management of the edit field (kernel of user interface in Survo),
Editorial computing and computing in touch mode,
Matrix interpreter,
Programming and usage of Survo macros (sucros),
Using Survo as a frontend for the R package and LaTex,
Making Web pages,
Screen graphics (GPLOT) and saving graphs in EMF files,
Following operations for general data management:
FILE CREATE, FILE SHOW, FILE MAKE,
FILE SAVE, FILE COPY, FILE LOAD, FILE SORT,
SHOW, SAVEP, LOADP, LOADM, VAR, CLASSIFY, SER
PRINT (for HTML and LaTeX, and one page PostScript output),
Statistical operations:
Basic statistics (STAT, MINSTAT),
Comparing samples by statistical tests (COMPARE),
Histograms and fitting one-dimensional distributions (GHISTO),
Creating multiway tables (TAB),
                                             (Continued on the next page)


Means, standard deviations, and correlations (CORR),
Multiple linear regression analysis (LINREG),
Non-linear regression analysis and ML estimation (ESTIMATE),
Factor analysis (FACTA),
Rotation of factor analysis (ROTATE),
Reliabilities of measurement scales (RELIAB),
Simulating multivariate normal distribution (MNSIMUL).
Game of Life (LIFEGAME)
Geometric constructions and their statistical accuracy (GEOM)

Survo Editor can be used for analysis of statistical data both in
teaching and research applications. It includes almost all mathematical
operations of SURVO MM such as the matrix interpreter, editorial and
touch mode computing, and combinatorics (COMB).
