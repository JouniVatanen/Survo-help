<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">DATAFIND &lt;text_file&gt;,L                                  / K.Vehkalahti 1996
finds data tables from &lt;text_file&gt;. The tables are written to a new text file,
the name of which is the same as the original, but its file type is `.DAF' .
That file is created to the current data path. Overwriting is confirmed, if a
file of that name already exists.

DATAFIND gives ready-to-use Survo commands for browsing the new text file and
possibly loading some tables to the edit field (SHOW), for creating data files
(FILE SAVE) and for listing those data files (INDEX). The commands are written
from line L onwards.

A common forepart for the names of the tables (and the data files) is taken
from the name of the &lt;text_file&gt; (at most 6 first letters). This can be altered
by specification NAME. For example, NAME=D implies names D1, D2, D3, and so on.

The data tables appear in the `.DAF'-file in the simplest form of a data matrix
representation of Survo (see <A HREF="q23_01.html">DATA</A>?). If no 'natural' names for the variables
are found, artificial names X1, X2, etc. are used. The names are modified, if
they are not unique to first eight characters.
                                                       Continued on next page...

Those tables where the logical lines are split on several physical lines, are
converted to the simplest form. This greatly simplifies the task of saving them
to Survo data files, because no FIELDS list in FILE SAVE is then needed.

DATAFIND also makes convertions when appropriate. Tab characters are replaced
by spaces. The comma sometimes causes problems, because it is used as a
parameter delimiter in Survo and as a decimal point in some other systems.
Actually, three different cases have to be considered: (converted form in
parenthesis)
  1) commas between numbers:  123,45  (123.45)
  2) commas as field delimiters:  12,34,5  (12 34 5)
  3) commas in pure text:  1st, 2nd, and 3rd  (1st; 2nd; and 3rd)
In addition, spaces are replaced by underscores when necessary. This applies
both to names and values of variables. In final form the data must have equal
number of words on every line.
