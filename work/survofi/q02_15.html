  WORDS initiates the definition of a sequence of words (sentence)
      either to be moved to another place or deleted.
      Prompts for alternative actions will appear on the bottom line.
      The sequence of words is defined by indicating the first letter
      of the first word by WORDS and the last letter of the last word
      by WORDS again.
      Thereafter the sequence is deleted by CTRL-END or moved to another
      place indicated by the cursor by WORDS. In the latter case the
      cursor should usually point to a space between two words.
      To preserve the sequence in its original position, enter insert
      mode before pressing WORDS. In any case, the sequence is saved
      in a special file and it can be copied to any place later
      by pressing WORDS in that place 4 times.
                                               (continued on next page)

  WORDS (continued)
      The text chapters are also automatically adjusted if a model
      for a suitable TRIM operation is given by a line of the form
          autotrim=TRIM3 72
      in the SURVO.APU file (See <A HREF="q0b_10.html">APU</A>?).
      (See also <A HREF="q02_17.html">BLOCK</A>?)
