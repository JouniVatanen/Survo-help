<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">Sucro memory (tutstack) operations:

{stack char}        saves the current character (touched by the cursor)
                    at the end of the tutstack.
{save char Wi}      saves the current character in the tutstack in Wi.

{stack word}        saves the current word (touched by the cursor)
                    at the end of the tutstack.
{save word Wi}      saves the current word in the tutstack in Wi.

{next word}         finds the next word on the current line. If the
                    next word is not in the visible part of the line,
                    the cursor is not moved.
{next col}          finds the next word on the current line. Also
                    words not currently visible on the line will be
                    found.

Sucro memory (tutstack) operations:                  (continued)

{stack cursor}      saves the number of the current edit line
                    and the number of the current column as two
                    last items in the tutstack.
{save cursor Wi,Wj} saves the number of the current edit line in Wi and
                    the number of the current column in Wj.

{stack corner}      saves the number of the first visible edit line
                    and the number of the first visible column as two
                    last items in the tutstack.
{save corner Wi,Wj} saves the number of the first visible edit line in Wi
                    and the number of the first visible column in Wj.

{stack dim}         saves the number of lines and number of columns
                    of the current edit field as two last items
                    in the tutstack.
{save dim Wi,Wj}    saves the number of lines of the current edit field
                    in Wi and the number of columns in Wj.
{save shadowdim Wi,Wj} saves the maximum number of shadow lines of the
                    edit field in Wi and the current number of them in Wj.

Sucro memory (tutstack) operations:                  (continued)

{stack line}         saves the current line from to the right from the
                     cursor at the end of the tutstack.
{save line Wi}       saves the current line from to the right from the
                     cursor in Wi.

{stack datapath}     saves the Survo data path (displayed on the header
                     line of the edit field) at the end of the tutstack.
{save datapath Wi}   saves the Survo data path in Wi.
{stack default datapath}
                     saves the default data path given by edisk in
                     SURVO.APU at the end of the tutstack.
{stack tempdisk}     saves the path for temporary files in Survo operations
                     given by tempdisk in SURVO.APU at the end of the tutstack.
{stack systemdisk}   saves the Survo system disk designation (typically
                     C:) at the end of the tutstack.
{save systemdisk Wi} saves the Survo system disk designation in Wi.
{save systempath Wi} saves the Survo system path designation (typically
                     C:\E\) in Wi.


Sucro memory (tutstack) operations:                  (continued)

{del stack}          clears the entire tutstack.
{del stack Wi}       clears the tutstack from Wi onwards.

{get key}            appends the next key pressed by the user to the
                     tutstack. In case of a special key. the tutstack
                     is appended by 'SK' and the function of the key
                     executed.
{get key Wi}         puts the next key pressed in Wi.
{save time Wi}       puts the current time (in milliseconds) elapsed
                     from the start of the Survo session in Wi.


Sucro memory (tutstack) operations:                  (continued)

{save stack}         saves the entire tutstack temporarily.
{load stack}         appends the tutstack saved by {save stack} to the
                     end of the current tutstack. Thus, to replace
                     the current tutstack by the saved one, use
                     {del stack}{load stack} .

{save stack &lt;file&gt;}  saves the current tutstack in file &lt;file&gt; on the
                     path of Survo temporary files (defined by tempdisk
                     in SURVO.APU)
{load stack &lt;file&gt;}  replaces the current tutstack by the one saved
                     earlier by {save stack &lt;file&gt;}. Please, note the
                     difference to {load stack}; no {del stack} is
                     needed.
                     The file name &lt;file&gt; can be given literally as
                     {save stack TEMP1} or through a tutstack member as
                     {save stack W1} .
{save field &lt;file&gt;}  saves the current edit field on the disk. Default
                     path is defined by tempdisk in SURVO.APU.

Sucro memory (tutstack) operations:                  (continued)

{print Wi}           prints the contents of Wi in the edit field
                     as a string.
{write Wi}           writes the contents of Wi in the edit field
                     as a string.
                     The 'write' command types text as if it were
                     written by the user (i.e. insert and display modes,
                     end of line, etc. are observed) while 'print'
                     simply sets down text regardless of display status.

{find Wi}            finds the next occurrence of the first character
                     of Wi on the current line.
{find string Wi}     finds the next occurrence of the string saved in
                     Wi on the current line. Wi can be replaced by a literal
                     string.
                     Examples: {W4= TO }{find string W4}  = Find " TO "
                               {find string ABC}          = Find "ABC"

Sucro memory (tutstack) operations:                  (continued)

{pre}l&lt;key&gt;          appends the label of the key to the tutstack.
                     For example, {pre}l{home} appends 'HOME'.

{jump Wi,Wj,Wk}      moves the cursor to line Wj and column Wk. The
                     line Wi is displayed as the first visible one.
                     Each of Wi,Wj,Wk can be replaced by a constant
                     integer.
{jump Wi,Wj,Wh,Wk}   works as jump above but displays Wh as the first
                     visible column.

Example: Save the cursor/edit field location by
         {save cursor Wrow,Wcol}{save corner Wrow1,Wcol1} .
         Return to this place by
         {jump Wrow1,Wrow,Wcol1,Wcol} .

{save survo.apu Wi}
                     saves the pathname of the default SURVO.APU file in Wi.
{save survo2.apu Wi}
                     saves the pathname of the current SURVO.APU file in Wi.

Sucro memory (tutstack) operations:                  (continued)

{save system &lt;system_word&gt; Wi}
                     saves the system parameter defined by
                     &lt;system_word&gt; in the Survo system file SURVO.APU
                     in Wi.
                     Example: {save system accuracy W3}
                     saves the 'accuracy' parameter in W3.
{save spec &lt;specification_word&gt; Wi}
                     saves the value of the specification given in the
                     current edit field by &lt;specification_word&gt; in Wi.
                     If the spefification doesn't exist, an empty
                     string {} is saved.
                     Example: {save spec DEVICE W4}
                     saves the current value of the DEVICE specification in W4.

{save spec2 Wj Wi}   save the value of the specification word given
                     in the current edit field as the value of Wj
                     in Wi.

Sucro memory (tutstack) operations:                  (continued)

{save language Wi}   saves the language of the current Survo version in Wi.
                     Wi=1: Finnish, Wi=2: English
{save survotype Wi}  saves the type of the current Survo version in Wi.
                     Wi=1: SURVO 84C, Wi=2: SURVOS Wi=3: SURVO 98,MM

{load sucro Wi}      continues with another sucro with name Wi.
{save insertmode Wi} saves 1 when insert mode is on, otherwise 0.
{save fieldtype Wi}  saves 1 when the current edit field cannot be
                     used in SURVO 84C, otherwise 0 is saved.
{save dataname Wi}   saves the name of current data file.
{save os Wi}         saves the name of the operating system.
                     Current alternatives: NT, Win98, Win95
{save version Wi}    saves the version number of the current SURVO MM.
{save winsize Wi,Wj} saves # of lines and # of columns of the Survo
                     main window.
