<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">XSCALE=&lt;min.value&gt;,&lt;2nd value&gt;,...,&lt;max.value&gt; 
(in PLOT operation for diagrams and curves) determines a linear scale
and the scale notations on the X axis. If XSCALE is not given,
scaling is automatic according to the current data.
In curve plotting default is XSCALE=-10,0,10.

Any point given in XSCALE may be labelled by text given after
a colon ':'.
For example, XSCALE=-3.1416:-pi,0,2.7183:e,3.1416:pi
determines a scale from -3.1416 to 3.1416 with scale notations
         -pi        0      e  pi

The short tick line marking the scale is omitted for any scale notation
by giving a '?' in front of the label:
For example in XSCALE=-10,0:?0,10
all the three points are labelled normally but '0' will appear without a
tick line.

Symbolic notations (without parentheses) are permitted as scale values.
Thus the previous example may be written as
XSCALE=-pi,0,e,pi  pi=3.1416 e=2.7183

Abbreviations of the form &lt;init value&gt;(&lt;step&gt;)&lt;final value&gt; may
also be used. For example XSCALE=0(1)5,6(2)12,15 generates the scale
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15  and
XSCALE=a(d)a+n*d  a=10 d=2 n=5 gives 10,12,14,16,18,20.

The points on the axis corresponding to scale notations are indicated
by tick lines drawn normally outside the the graph area. Their length
and direction can be adjusted by specifications TICKLENGTH and TICKTURN.

XSCALE=&lt;scale type&gt;,&lt;min.value&gt;,...,&lt;max.value&gt; 
(in PLOT operation for diagrams and curves) determines a nonlinear
scale. The rules are same as those of the previous form of XSCALE.

&lt;scale type&gt; is given in the form *f(x) (*f(y) for YSCALE), where
f is any monotonous function of x (y).
In addition to standard functions (sqrt,log,exp etc.) and their
combinations also the inverse cumulative distribution function
of the standard normal distribution is available by name probit.
Example: XSCALE=*log(x),1,2,5,10,20,50,100
         YSCALE=*probit(y),0.001,0.01,0.1,0.5,0.9,0.99,0.999

The X scale notations can also be located above the graph by using
the XSCALE2 specification and similarly the Y scale notations may
appear in the right margin, too, by using YSCALE2.
