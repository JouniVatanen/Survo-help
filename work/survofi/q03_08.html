<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">CD &lt;path designation&gt; 
selects the data path. By default all operations of Survo use this path.
The current choice is displayed on the header line of the edit field.
If the given path does not exist, an error message is displayed.
The OS default disk and directory are changed accordingly. This helps
giving OS commands from Survo, as no pathnames need to be specified.
If no path is given, the default data path, given by the system parameter
'edisk', is used. (See also <A HREF="q0b_10.html">SYSTEM</A>?).
DISK &lt;path designation&gt; 
also selects the data path, but does not change the OS path. This was the
original setting in Survo: the OS default path was the same as the system
path (e.g. C:\E) all the time. Since v.5.00, and the desktop operations
(see <A HREF="qkv0_01.html">DESKTOP</A>?), this has been changed to allow easier reference to files by
OS commands without specifying the pathnames, for example. To keep using of
the system coherent, only either one of DISK and CD can be used. Now CD is
used instead of DISK in all sucro tools of the system, so its usage is
strongly recommended. DISK is considered obsolete, but it may be needed in
some special applications.
