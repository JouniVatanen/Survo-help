<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">User interaction during Survo operations

When a Survo operation involving user interaction (like FILE SHOW) is
activated in a sucro, the sucro in question normally takes the
responsibility of all actions of the user (like entering data values in
FILE SHOW) during that operation.
However, in some applications, it is useful that the sucro stands still
during such an operation thus letting the user to work on his/her own
until the end of the operation. For example, one would like to create
a data entry routine as a sucro using the FILE SHOW operation for
actual data input as such. To enable this kind of user interaction
in a sucro, the code word {interaction on} should be given in the
sucro code before activating the operation in question by {act}.
To resume the default working mode of sucros, the code word
{interaction off} must given after {act}.

Example:
FILE SHOW {print Wdata}{interaction on}{act}{interaction off}
