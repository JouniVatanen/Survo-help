<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">Many of the multivariate statistical operations are working under the
control of the Survo matrix interpreter.
Hence the input data sets have to be converted to matrix (MAT) files
before activating such an operation.
In many cases, also correlation matrices, factor matrices as well as
other intermediate results obtained as matrix files are used as input in
multivariate methods.

In addition to the normal textual output, the multivariate operations
give their main results as matrix files which then again may serve as
input in later operations.
Some of these output matrices consist of weighting coefficients
and are employed for computing various linear combinations of original
variables by the LINCO operation. Thus LINCO is the main link back to
data files.
