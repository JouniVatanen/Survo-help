<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">Searches are initiated by the alt-F5 (SEARCH) key.
The search takes place according to the values of the current field
or # of the record. Permitted conditions (search keys) are, for example,
  &lt;100  &gt;=25.5  &lt;&gt;1 (not equal to 1)
In string fields the search key is a sequence of characters and the
search is succesful when a case starting with this sequence is found.
In addition, a partial string (in the middle of the field) can be
searched for, by using a search word of the form *&lt;string&gt;.
The search is sequential from the current record onwards. The search
is stopped when the first succesful record has been found and this
record will be displayed. The search can then be continued simply by
pressing ESC. If only number of succesful cases is wanted, press
PREFIX ESC.
The sequential search is replaced in string field by the much faster
binary search if a specification of the form SORT:&lt;sort_field&gt; appears
in the general file description (between FILE CREATE and FIELDS lines).
It is then assumed that the file has been sorted in alphabetic order
with respect to the field in question. In fact, the FILE SORT operation
adds this specification automatically to the sorted file.

In FILE SHOW also fields (variables, columns) can be searched for
by their names. This is relevant when there are very many active
fields. To initiate such a search, press PREFIX alt-F5 .
