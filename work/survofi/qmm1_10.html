<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">DIST &lt;data&gt;,&lt;matrix_file&gt; 
computes a distance or dissimilarity matrix of active
observations from active variables.
There is another Survo module DISTV for a distance matrix of active
variables.
A special form of DIST computes the distance of each observation to
the closest of given center observations (see <A HREF="qmm2_03.html">DISTC</A>?).

The results are saved in &lt;matrix_file&gt; with default extension .MAT .

If a string variable is activated by `L', the 8 first characters of it
are used as row and column labels in &lt;matrix_file&gt;.
Otherwise, if the first active variable is a string, it will serve
as a label variable. Otherwise labels will be integers 1,2,...

&lt;matrix file&gt; can be used as an input in /CSCAL and LSCAL operations,
for example.

The dissimilarity measure used is selected by a MEASURE specification
with following alternatives (see T.C.Cox &amp; M.A.A.Cox: Multidimensional
Scaling, Chapman &amp; Hall p.10):

EUCLIDEAN, MAHALANOBIS, CITY_BLOCK,
MINKOWSKI(k)   (k&gt;0)
CANBERRA, BRAY_CURTIS, BHATTACHARYYA,
ANGULAR        (Angular separation)
CORRELATION    (1 - correlation)
BINARY         (various measures for binary variables; see next page)

Three first letters are sufficient like MEASURE=MIN(2) which is the
same as MEASURE=EUC . Also MEASURE=MIN(1) is the same as MEASURE=CITY .

The variables can be standardized by SCALING=YES .
The variables are also weighted by WEIGHTS=&lt;vector_of_weights_as_matrix_file&gt;.
The order of weights must be the same as the order of active
variables in &lt;data&gt;.

In case MEASURE=BINARY various user-defined (dis)similarity measures
for binary data are used.
By default each active variable is converted to a binary one by mapping
values X&lt;=0 to 0 and values X&gt;0 to 1.
This convention is overridden by giving a specification BINARY=C
Then values X&lt;=C are mapped to 0 and values X&gt;C to 1.
An optional parameter R in BINARY=C,R exchanges the values 0 and 1.
Both of the above conventions can be overridden individually in any
variable, say Z, by entering a specification Z=C or Z=C,R with
the same interpretation as in the BINARY specification.

The actual (dis)similarity coefficient for binary data is entered
as a specification COEFF=&lt;function of a,b,c,d&gt; where a,b,c,d are the
frequencies in a 2x2 table
       1      0
   1   a      b
   0   c      d
for each pair of observations.
For example, COEFF=1-(a+d)/(a+b+c+d)  gives a dissimilarity measure
which is the complement of a simple matching coefficient (default).
