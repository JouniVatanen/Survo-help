<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">Control words and commands in sucro programs:

 {end}           terminates the program.
 {init}          performs intialization of certain display parameters.
                 It guarantees, for example, that insert mode is not on,
                 the reference point is cancelled, the first column is
                 set to the point of return when ENTER is pressed, no
                 blocks and shadow lines are being defined, etc.
                 {init} neither affects the position of the cursor
                 nor changes the contents of the edit field.
 {break off}     prevents the effects of keys .  + and - used in the
                 sucro run for speed control and stopping.
                 Used in keyboard sucros.
 {break on}      cancels the effect of {break off}.

 {message}       {message}&lt;string&gt; 
                 displays a message &lt;string&gt; on the bottom line.
                 To cancel the message (this must be done always before
                 normal termination of a sucro), use {message}@ .
 {message Wi}    displays a message contained in Wi .

Control words and commands in sucro programs:         (Continuation)

 {message shadow &lt;char&gt;}
                 sets the shadow character (color) used in messages.
                 Default is {message shadow 1} (red).

 {wait &lt;time&gt;}   sets a wait of &lt;time&gt; in 0.1 seconds before continuing.
 {tempo &lt;speed&gt;} sets the basic speed of the sucro.
                 Default is {tempo 2}. {tempo 1} is the fastest possible.
                 {tempo -1} increases the speed by 1 and {tempo +1}
                 slows it down by 1. Normally only these relative forms
                 should be used.
 {keys i}        (i=0,1,2) indicates whether the labels of the keys
                 'pressed' by the sucro are displayed.
                 {keys 0} (default) no display
                 {keys 1} key labels are displayed
                 {keys 2} the user is requested to press the key dis-
                          played before proceeding.

Control words and commands in sucro programs:         (Continuation)

 {next word}     finds the next 'word' on the visible part of the current
                 line.
 {next col}      works as {next word} but finds also words outside the visible
                 part of the current line.
 {ref set i}     defines the current cursor/screen position as an
                 additional reference point i (i=1,2,...,8).
 {ref jump i}    returns the cursor to the point defined by {ref set i}.
 {ref del i}     removes the additional reference point i.
 {disp off}      disables the screen. Text is written normally in
                 the edit field but not shown on the screen.
 {disp on}       restores the normal screen display (also from graphics mode).
 {disp reset}    as {disp on} but does not set off the graphics mode.
                 If no graphics has not been generated under display off mode,
                 {disp reset} (faster alternative) is preferred to {disp on}.
 {labels off}    makes the line numbers and control characters invisible.
 {labels on}     restores the line numbers and control characters.

Control words and commands in sucro programs:         (Continuation)

 {paint on}      words/chars saved by {save word} or {save char} are painted.
 {paint off}     exits painting mode.
 {soft_on}       makes the soft buttons below the main window visible.
 {soft_off}      makes the soft buttons below the main window invisible.

 {play sound &lt;WAV_file&gt;} plays a sound file.
 {play sound Wi}         plays a sound file (name given in Wi).
