<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">SURVO MM allows creating and saving of edit fields up to the capacity
of the central memory of the computer. For example, in a 128KB memory
it is possible to maintain edit fields of 500000 lines with 100 or
more columns. The maximum number of columns is 996 (10006 from ver.3)
but there is no (practical) upper limit for the number of lines.
Very large fields are needed only in special applications and temporary
situations; for example, when irregular text files (created elsewhere)
should be polished. In general, it is not wise to keep big data sets in
the edit field.

When an edit field does not exceed the capacity of SURVO 84C (about
60000 bytes), it is saved in SURVO MM (by the SAVE command) exactly
in the same way as in SURVO 84C.
Large fields with more than 252 columns and/or too many lines are
saved in a new form where only non-empty lines (with their line
numbers and possible shadow lines) are stored. Also trailing blanks
are omitted and thus much space is spared on the disk.
These SURVO MM edit files are in fact simple text files.
`Over-sized' edit files cannot be used in SURVO 84C as edit fields
but they can be treated there as text files (by LOADP and SHOW).

An over-sized edit field is indicated by a red square   almost at the end
of the header line.

As an option (in dealing with certain system files) an over-sized
edit field can be saved in the old SURVO 84C format by setting
string "(84ED)" in the comment of the SAVE command on the first edit line.
Example:

    1 *SAVE BIGTEXT / over-sized field (84ED)
    2 *
 -----
 9999 *
10000 * This is the last line!

This (84ED) option should be never used in standard applications
since it creates very large files.
