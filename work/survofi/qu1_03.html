<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">TABTEST &lt;table_of_frequencies&gt;,L
performs various tests for independence etc. by simulation
for a two-dimensional table of frequencies. The table is
given in edit field in the form used by the TAB operations.
The table can be also given in a simpler form without any labels:
TABLE TEST / Example (An empty line indicates the end of the table.)
7 2 0
3 1 5

Different assumptions about the stochastic structure of the table are
determined by a FIX specification with following alternatives:
   FIX=Fisher  Both row and column margins fixed (exact test)
   FIX=RC      Both row and column margins fixed
   FIX=C       Column margins (vertical sums) fixed
   FIX=R       Row margins (horizontal sums) fixed
   FIX=N       No fixed margins, only the grand total fixed
   FIX=F(i,j)  Element of row i and column j fixed
   FIX=FIT     Goodness of fit test for an n x 2 table

The test statistics used in simulation is selected by a TEST specification:
TEST=X^2 is the common Pearson's chi-square statistics: sum of (O-E)^2/E .
TEST=G^2 is the likelihood statistics: sum of -2*O*log(O/E) .
TEST=PROB is the probability of the simulated table. The unknown
          margin probabilities are replaced by simulated relative
          frequencies. We call this `Probability statistics'.
In case FIX=Fisher, TEST=PROB is always selected.
In other cases TEST=X^2 is default.

Maximum number of replicates is given by SIMUMAX (default 10000000).
The seed number of the random number generator (either 'rand' or 'urand')
is given by RAND (default RAND=rand(12345). See <A HREF="qv3_01.html">RAND</A>? .
The process may be interrupted by pressing any key.

The results are displayed after each 100 replicates as a table of the form
      N           P               Confidence interval (level=0.95)
# of replicates   Estimate of P                lower limit
            s.e.  Standard error               upper limit

The confidence level for P is set by CONF=p (0.8&lt;p&lt;1). Default is CONF=0.95
The two-way table is also saved as a matrix by using the specification
MATRIX=&lt;name_of_a_matrix_file&gt; , say, MATRIX=T .
This matrix can be analyzed further, for example, by the sucro command
/X2
which computes various derived tables as matrices such as the expected
frequencies and decomposition of the X^2 statistics in cells and
margins.
