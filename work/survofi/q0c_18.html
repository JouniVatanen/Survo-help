<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">Survo is normally started from a shortcut icon "SURVO MM" (or
"Survo Editor") located on the desktop.
Each shortcut is controlled by Windows using a corresponding LNK file.
In Windows XP (and obviously also in NT and 2000) the properties
of the Survo main window (i.e. font size and location) are changed
most conveniently by the WINDOW command (for the current session)
or by "SYS window=..." command (for a permanent change).
These commands do not change the original LNK file.

However, if same properties are edited by clicking the Survo icon
(and selecting properties), the LNK file will be updated by Windows
and this leads to a situation where the above Survo commands have
no effect.

It means that Windows has also created a subkey
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console\&lt;path&gt;S
where &lt;path&gt; is the path of Survo on the disk.
Then the problem is resolved by deleting this key from the registry
by the REGEDIT program, for example.
Warning! Be careful when editing the Windows registry since improper
         actions may lead to harmful consequences.
