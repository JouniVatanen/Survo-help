0023|#FILE SHOW <data_file>
S   |           <         >
0024|*is an overall tool for scanning and editing of Survo data files.
0025|*The file will be shown on the screen so that each record takes one
0026|*line. In the traditional 24 line mode, 21 consecutive records are shown
0027|*simultaneously. When more space is reserved for the main window by
0028|*the RESIZE command, the number of records and cases shown simultaneously
0029|*is correspongingly greater.
0030|*The active fields are displayed as columns.
0031|*There are no limitations for number of fields and records.
0032|*Records (lines) can be scrolled by PgDn, PgUp, ArrowUp, ArrowDn and
0033|*fields (columns) by TAB, END and HOME keys.
0034|*To get permission for editing of data values, F3 must be pressed once.
0035|*Most of the keys have the same tasks as in the edit field. However,
0036|*the functions of INSERT, DELETE and ctrl-END (erase) are limited to
0037|*the current field.

0070|*In FILE SHOW, the fields are displayed in formats given in the field
0071|*descriptions in the form (###.##) . To edit these formats, use FILE
0072|*STATUS and FILE UPDATE. If no format is given for a particular field,
0073|*the default format is:
0074|*           ###  for 1 byte numeric field,
0075|*        ######  for 2 byte numeric field,
0076|*   #######.###  for 4 and 8 byte numeric fields,
0077|*   entire field width for a string field.
0078|*Missing values appear always as empty fields.
0079|*If the data value exceeds the limits given by the current format,
0080|*an empty field terminated by '*' will be displayed instead.
0081|*To see the true value of such a field, touch it by the cursor. Then
0082|*the value will be displayed on the top line.
0085|*Setting limits for values:
0086|*When editing numerical fields, extra limits may be set by the limit
0087|aspecifications of the form {lower_limit,upper_limit} in the field
0088|*descriptions. These limits can be altered by FILE UPDATE.
0090|*The values of a string field can be limited to a predetermined set
0091|*by giving the permitted values as a list of the form [value1,value2,...]
0092|*in the field description.
0093|*For example, [A,B,C] tells that 'A','B', and 'C' are the only possible values.

0110|*The current record is deleted from the data file by alt-F10 key.
0111|*An empty record is inserted after the current record by the alt-F9 key.
0113|*When records are inserted and deleted (or moved by alt-F4), the FILE
0114|*SHOW operation does not change the contents of the data file immediately,
0115|*but creates a special indicator vector for this purpose. If n is the
0116|*number of records, an extra space of 4*(n+1000) bytes is needed in the CPU.
0117|*This space will be automatically reserved by FILE SHOW. In very large
0118|*data files of, say more than 40000 records, allocation of the extra
0119|*space may be impossible. In that case FILE SHOW will give a message
0120|*and operations like FILE EDIT or FILE COPY should be used for the task.
0121|*The maximum number of new records to be inserted between the old ones
0122|*is 1000.
0123|*When records have been inserted and deleted in the preceding manner,
0124|*and FILE SHOW is terminated (by F8), the pertinent information will be
0125|*copied from the current data file to a new one (SURVO.XXX) on the
0126|*same path on the disk. Then the original file is deleted and SURVO.XXX
0127|*renamed with the true name.
0129|*Please, note that the restrictions above do not apply to new records typed
0130|*at the end of the data. There are no relevant limits for the number of
0131|*old and new records.

0175|*Searches are initiated by the alt-F5 (SEARCH) key.
0176|*The search takes place according to the values of the current field
0177|*or # of the record. Permitted conditions (search keys) are, for example,
0178|*  <100  >=25.5  <>1 (not equal to 1)
S   |   <     >       <>
0179|*In string fields the search key is a sequence of characters and the
0180|*search is succesful when a case starting with this sequence is found.
0181|*In addition, a partial string (in the middle of the field) can be
0182|*searched for, by using a search word of the form *<string>.
S   |                                                   <      >

0184|*is stopped when the first succesful record has been found and this
0185|*record will be displayed. The search can then be continued simply by
0186|*pressing ESC. If only number of succesful cases is wanted, press
0187|*PREFIX ESC.
0188|*The sequential search is replaced in string field by the much faster
0189|*binary search if a specification of the form SORT:<sort_field> appears

0193|*adds this specification automatically to the sorted file.

0208|*SOUND.BIN is a binary file of 256 characters. It can be edited by the

0214|*The value for standard pitch ( a = 440 hz) is given as the second byte
0215|*in SOUND.BIN. Default is 65.
0216|*The first byte in SOUND.BIN is the duration of each sound.
0217|*In the default setting of SOUND.BIN, the letters give the chromatic
