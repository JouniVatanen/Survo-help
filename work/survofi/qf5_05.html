<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">The structure of a Survo data file can be updated (for example, more
fields defined) by activating  a FILE UPDATE operation:
FILE UPDATE &lt;name of Survo data file&gt; 
followed by a complete description of the file structure.

In the latter case the set-up is similar to that of FILE CREATE and the
current status in the data file is always easily obtained in that form
in the edit field by activating a FILE STATUS operation.

In FILE UPDATE only those fields need to be described which
are to be changed and new variables may be defined in this way.
Also the free description of the file contents (given between FILE
UPDATE and FIELDS:) can be edited, but number of lines used for it
originally cannot be increased. The type of the field and the length
of it cannot be changed either.
For example, to add three new variables in the data file COMMUNES
(see <A HREF="qf1_01.html">FILE</A> CREATE) the following FILE UPDATE could be activated:

FILE UPDATE COMMUNES
FIELDS:
   6 S   1  Agri     Proportion of people in agriculture (scale 0-9)
   7 S   1  Industry Proportion of people in industry    (scale 0-9)
   8 S   1  Service  Proportion of people in service etc.(scale 0-9)
