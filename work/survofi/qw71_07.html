<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText"><STRONG>The FEDIT keyboard</STRONG> 

The cursor moves from one field to another field on a form from left
to right and from top to bottom. However, the fields belonging to the
same selection group are passed before other fields. The location of
the first field in a selection group defines the order of that group
compared to other fields or groups.

The following list summarizes the special keys used in FEDIT. Note
that some keys have slightly different meanings in standard and selec-
tion fields.

Cursor Right  <EM>Standard fields</EM>: Moves the cursor one character to the
              rigth in the field or to the next field if the right
              margin of the field is exceeded.
              <EM>Selection fields</EM>: Moves the cursor to the next
              selection field.
Cursor Down   Moves the cursor to the next standard or selection
              field in the form.
Cursor Left   <EM>Standard fields</EM>: Moves the cursor one character to the
              left in the field, or to the previous field if the left
              margin of the field is exceeded.
              <EM>Selection fields</EM>: Moves the cursor to the previous
              selection field.
Cursor up     Moves the cursor to the previous field in the form.

PgDn          The cursor is moved down by "one page" in the form, to the
              next form or to the next observation. If selection fields
              in one group extend over several pages, moving is done
              done within the same group.
PgUp          The cursor is moved up by "one page" in the same form or
              to the previous form. If the cursor is on the first page
              of the first form, then <EM>PgUp</EM> moves the cursor in the first
              form of the previous observation. If the cursor is in a
              "long" selection group, moving is done within the same
              group.
Ctrl PgDn     The cursor is moved to the first form of the next
              observation.
Ctrl PgUp     The cursor is moved to the first form of the previous
              observation.

HOME          The cursor is moved to the first field on the current form.
END           The cursor is moved to that last field on the current form.

INS           Insert/overwrite mode toggle.
DEL           Standard fields: Deletes character at the cursor.
              Selection fields: Deletes the selection at the cursor. All
              lower order selections are deleted too. E.g. if the first
              selection is deleted, then all other selections will be
              deleted, too.
ESC           Interrupts the selection in one group (without
              entering the maximum number of selections).

BACKSPACE     First the character to the left of the cursor is erased
              and then the cursor is moved one character to the left.

ALT F5        Searches for a value of the variable indicated by the
              cursor or moves to the given observation defined
              by its sequence number. An old search may be repeat-
              ed by using the Cursor Up key (the last 9 searches are
              saved).
ALT F9        Inserts observations after the current observation.
ALT F10       Deletes observations including the current observation.
F2 - P        The current form is copied in the edit field.
F1            Help for keys. The content of the help window depends
              on the type of the field indicated by the cursor.
F8            Exit
