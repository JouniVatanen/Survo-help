<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">Several SURVO MM sessions may be running simultaneously.
Each session is initiated by clicking the SURVO MM icon.
Thus the user may type a research report in one session while another
copy of Survo is carrying out a long simulation experiment.

If you want to use this multisession property very heavily (many
Survos doing hard work automatically at the same time) it is good to set
session_tmp=1
in the SURVO.APU file.

By this setting each Survo session will have its own subdirectory for
temporary files and then there will be no confusion with those files
although concurrent Survo sessions are performing similar tasks.

For a temporary usage a "slave Survo" can be called by keys F2 M Z.
More information by activating
/Z ?

Temporary files:
Many Survo program modules are creating and using various temporary
files for saving intermediate results, for example.

Temporary files are saved in the directory
&lt;Survo&gt;\TMP (typically C:\Program Files\SURVO\TMP) or according to
etmpd=&lt;path&gt; 
given in the SURVO.APU file.

To provide a separate subdirectory for temporary files in each Survo
session,
session_tmp=1
must be given in SURVO.APU.
Then these subdirectories are created by Survo and they are
&lt;Survo&gt;\TMP\A, &lt;Survo&gt;\TMP\B, etc. by default.
In this case the corresponding subdirectory is also removed when the
Survo session is terminated. However, if del_tmp=0 is given in
SURVO.APU, the subdirectory for temporary files is not removed.
