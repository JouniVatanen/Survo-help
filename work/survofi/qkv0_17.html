<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">Useful information on file names and comments

Traditionally, a file name consists of eight characters at most. In addition,
there is the file type (for example .EDT or .SVO), which is often determined
automatically. It is a good style to give short names for things. However,
sometimes longer names may be useful, e.g. when transporting files from
Survo to other systems like WWW. Within Survo there is no need to apply any
longer names. Actually it is even recommended that very short names are used,
for example T1, T2, T3, etc., since more information on the content of the
files can be represented by comments.

Most file types of Survo allow additional comments to be written freely.
The most important files are the saved edit fields (.EDT). When saving
an edit field, write the SAVE command on the first line like this:
<B>SAVE ART3C / part 3 of the article, practical example (9.1.2002)</B> 
Then, the file name will be "ART3C.EDT", while the rest of the line is saved
as a part of the content. It will be used by various Survo operations, like
INDEX, DD, SEARCH, the Menu of Jobs, and the List of References.
