<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">After the key PREFIX (F2) has been pressed, a small rectangle is displayed
in the left upper corner of the screen and the next key will have the
following function:

PREFIX PREFIX:
   Move the cursor to the end of the visible line.
PREFIX ESC:
   Activation to run mode. (Operations on consecutive lines will be
   performed until '.' is pressed or an invalid operation is met.)
PREFIX (DOWN):
   Move the cursor to the last line of the current page or if it is
   already there, to the last non-empty line of the edit field.
PREFIX ENTER:
   The current column is defined as the return position when ENTER
   is pressed. This feature simplifies typing of columns.
PREFIX T:
   Prefix for various functions in tutorial mode:
   PREFIX T S  opens a tutorial file for saving of key strokes,
   PREFIX T E  closes a tutorial file,
   PREFIX T R  starts a tutorial (alternative for TUTOR operation).

PREFIX S:
   Displays the shadow line of the current line below the current line.
   The shadow line can then be edited as a normal edit line.
   To restore the original display after editing, press
   PREFIX S again.
   Please note that the standard display effects which are controlled
   by the FORM key correspond to values 1-7 on the shadow line.
   The maximum number of shadow lines is 20 for each edit field, unless
   otherwise stated by REDIM.
PREFIX P:
   Picks the character indicated by the cursor to be used as the extra
   character which can be typed by the CODE key.
   This is a useful method in typing and copying special characters
   which already appear in the edit field.

PREFIX INSERT:
   initiates use of automatic insert mode. Thereafter mere INSERT
   selects/deselects insert mode.
PREFIX DELETE:
   cancels use of automatic insert mode. Thereafter mere INSERT
   always inserts one space in the current cursor position.
PREFIX INS_LINE  (F2 alt-F9)
   inserts the last line deleted by DEL_LINE.
PREFIX &lt;key&gt;:
   where &lt;key&gt;=1,2,...,9 writes macros M1,M2,...M9 defined in SURVO.APU
   in the form M1=SCRATCH, M2=LOAD INDEX, etc.
   Macros above only write text in the edit field. To make them self-
   activating, put `!' to the end of the text.
   For example, M9=/MY_APPL! means that whenever keys PREFIX 9 are pressed,
   sucro MY_APPL will be immediately activated.
   Please note that macros are temporarily created and altered by
   commands of type SYSTEM M9=/MY_APPL!
PREFIX -:
   saves the number of the current edit line so that it can be copied
   by the keys COPY (alt-F3) '-' ENTER or displayed in the edit field
   by activating -=_

The following key combinations are useful especially when making
sucros in the tutorial mode. The corresponding statement of the
sucro language is given in braces.

PREFIX W:    {next word}
   seeks the next word on the current line.
PREFIX C &lt;character&gt;:  {find &lt;character&gt;}
   seeks the next occurrence of &lt;character&gt; on the current line.
PREFIX R:    {stack cursor}
   saves the current line and column of the cursor as two last items
   in the sucro memory.
PREFIX =:    {print W1}
   prints the first item of the sucro memory in the edit field.
PREFIX @ i: (i=1,2,...,9)   {print Wi}
   prints the ith word of the sucro memory in the edit field as it were
   a result of a Survo operation (shadow line unaffected etc.).
PREFIX # i: (i=1,2,...,9)   {write Wi}
   writes the ith item of the sucro memory in the edit field as it were
   typed by the user (insert mode and shadow mode observed).

PREFIX x:    {stack char}
   appends the current character indicated by the cursor to the sucro memory.
PREFIX w:    {stack word}
   appends the current `word' indicated by the cursor to the sucro memory.
PREFIX 0:    {del stack}
   clears the sucro memory.
PREFIX I:    {pre}I
   cancels the insert mode.

PREFIX y:    {get key}
   appends the next key pressed by the user to the sucro memory.
   In case of a special key, word SK is appended and the function
   of the key executed.
   This code can be used for making keyboard sucros that alter the
   functions of ordinary typewriter keys in special applications. The
   functions of the function and other special keys cannot be altered.

PREFIX M &lt;char&gt;:
   activates a key sucro with one-letter name &lt;char&gt;.TUT .
PREFIX N &lt;char&gt;:
   activates a key sucro with name #&lt;char&gt;.TUT (Example: #S.TUT)
PREFIX !&lt;name&gt; ENTER:
   activates sucro &lt;name&gt; without echoing the call.
PREFIX D:    {pre}D
   deletes the current reference point (set by REF).

PREFIX J:    {pre}J
   initiates a search for an incomplete word just before the cursor
   and completes it by the first matching word found in the current
   edit field.
   Example: Assume that the user has written...
      Ouagadougou is the capital of Burkina Faso.
      The population of Ou_
   By pressing PREFIX J the system will complete the word as
      The population of Ou<B>agadougou</B> 
   and the user can continue typing.

PREFIX d:    {save datapath}
   puts the current Survo data path in the sucro memory.
PREFIX g:    {save systemdisk}
   puts the Survo system disk designation (C:) in the sucro memory.
PREFIX l &lt;any_key&gt;:
   puts the key label of &lt;any_key&gt; (name of key) in the sucro memory.
PREFIX X:    {save line}
   puts the current edit line to the right from the cursor in
   the sucro memory. Trailing spaces are omitted.
PREFIX B:    {line start}
   moves the cursor to the beginning of the current edit line.

PREFIX A:    {pre}A
   enables (when the insert mode is on) automatic insertion of space
   for new lines.
PREFIX a:    {pre}a
   cancels automatic insertion of lines in insert mode.
PREFIX b:    {init}
   initializes the display parameters of the edit field.
PREFIX u &lt;char&gt;: {message shadow &lt;char&gt;}
   selects the shadow character for the prompt line (default 1=red).
PREFIX L o:  {disp off}
   disables the screen. Text is written normally in the edit field but
   not shown on the screen.
PREFIX L O:  {disp on}
   restores the normal screen display
PREFIX L 0:  {disp reset}
   restores the normal screen display (i.e. same as PREFIX L O)

PREFIX L l:  {labels off}
   hides the line numbers and labels.
PREFIX L L:  {labels on}
   displays again the line numbers and labels.
PREFIX L W:  {waitrec on}
   initiates recording of waiting times between consecutive key strokes
   when working in tutorial mode (defining sucros).
PREFIX L w:  {waitrec off}
   cancels recording of waiting times.

PREFIX F: {pre}F
   enables typing and pasting long lines (exceeding the Survo window width).
   For example, wide tables can be correctly pasted in the edit field.
PREFIX f: {pre}f
   cancels the PREFIX F typing/pasting mode.
PREFIX L K: {pre}L K
   appends the number of empty lines at the end of edit field to tutstack.
PREFIX alt-F6: {pre}{file act}
   activates a 'new' data file to be selected by the user.
   (Note: alt-F6 activates the current data file.)
PREFIX F4: {pre}{disk}
   writes the system path of Survo in the edit field.
PREFIX |: works as the search key alt-F5 but limits the search for
   the words starting from the first column in the edit field.
