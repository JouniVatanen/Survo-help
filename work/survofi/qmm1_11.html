<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">DISTV &lt;data&gt;,&lt;matrix_file&gt; 
computes a distance or (dis)similarity matrix of active variables (!)
for active observations.
There is another Survo module DIST for a distance matrix of active
observations.

The results are saved in &lt;matrix_file&gt; with default extension .MAT .

&lt;matrix file&gt; can be used as an input in /CSCAL and LSCAL operations,
for example. In this case the matrix must consist of dissimilarities.

The (dis)similarity measure used is selected by a MEASURE specification
with following alternatives (see T.C.Cox &amp; M.A.A.Cox: Multidimensional
Scaling, Chapman &amp; Hall p.10):

EUCLIDEAN
CITY_BLOCK
MINKOWSKI(k)   (k&gt;0)
CORRELATION    (1 - correlation)
BINARY         (various measures for binary variables; see next page)

Three first letters are sufficient like MEASURE=MIN(2) which is the
same as MEASURE=EUC . Also MEASURE=MIN(1) is the same as MEASURE=CITY .

The variables can be standardized by SCALING=YES .
The observations are weighted by activating a weight variable by `W'.

In case MEASURE=BINARY various user-defined (dis)similarity measures
for binary variables are used.
By default each active variable is converted to a binary one by mapping
values X&lt;=0 to 0 and values X&gt;0 to 1.
This convention is overridden by giving a specification BINARY=C
Then values X&lt;=C are mapped to 0 and values X&gt;C to 1.
An optional parameter R in BINARY=C,R exchanges the values 0 and 1.
Both of the above conventions can be overridden individually in any
variable, say Z, by entering a specification Z=C or Z=C,R with
the same interpretation as in the BINARY specification.

The actual (dis)similarity coefficient for binary variables is entered
as a specification COEFF=&lt;function of a,b,c,d&gt; where a,b,c,d are the
frequencies in a 2x2 table
   X/Y 1      0
   1   a      b
   0   c      d
for each pair X,Y of variables.
For example, COEFF=1-(a+d)/(a+b+c+d)  gives a dissimilarity measure
which is the complement of a simple matching coefficient (default).
