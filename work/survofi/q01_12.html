<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">Links to other programs and to the web

Files made by other programs as well as websites can be opened
while working in Survo simply by activating (path)names of files
and website addresses appearing within the text in the edit field.
For example, the website of Survo is opened by activating <A HREF="http://www.survo.fi">www.survo.fi</A> 
by the double-click or by the ESC key.
Similarly, when activating a filename of a PDF file, say D:\PAPERS\DOC1.PDF,
Survo calls the START command of the Windows command interpreter
to open this file by the program (typically Adobe Acrobat) associated
to this filetype (see in Windows 'Folder options' -&gt; 'File types').

Typical filetypes of Survo like edit files (.EDT), data files (.SVO),
matrix files (.MAT), etc. can be browsed by activating their pathnames
typed in the edit field using suitable 'show' commands.

Please note that if an edit line containing a link word starts by a valid
Survo command word, the command is always activated in the first place.

Associations described above are defined in a Survo system file OPEN.SYS.
More details (for advanced users) on the next page!

System file OPEN.SYS
This text file defines the Survo associations for immediate access
to files maintained by the web browser, other programs, or Survo itself.
LOADP &lt;Survo&gt;\U\SYS\OPEN.SYS
0 www.     /OPEN
0 http://  /OPEN             / Only beginning of the file is displayed here.
0 *.html   /OPEN             / /OPEN is a sucro which simply activates
0 *.htm    /OPEN             / the START command.
1 *.pdf    /OPEN
1 *.edt    SHOW
1 *.txt    SHOW
1 *.svo    FILE SHOW
1 *.mat    /MATSHOW
etc.

For example, the line
0 www.     /OPEN
tells that any string in the edit field starting by "www.", say <A HREF="http://www.survo.fi">www.survo.fi,</A> 
will be opened by the command /OPEN <A HREF="http://www.survo.fi">www.survo.fi</A>. The '0' as the first
item says that iterpretation of the keyword "www." is case-sensitive.
                                      (To be continued on the next page)

Thus in this case Survo activates the command interpreter by
&gt;START <A HREF="http://www.survo.fi">www.survo.fi</A> 
which according to standard Windows associations calls the default
web browser to show the page in the given address.

Other examples:
1 *.pdf    /OPEN
opens a PDF file with the extension .pdf by using a program which is
associated to these files in Windows. '1' in front of the line tells
that the keyword "*.pdf" is not case-sensitive.
1 *.svo    FILE SHOW
creates and activates the Survo command
FILE SHOW &lt;Survo_data_file_with_the_extension_.SVO&gt; 
For example, if G:\STUDY1\SAMPLE1.SVO is activated, Survo tries to
open a Survo data file (extension .SVO) by the command
FILE SHOW G:\STUDY1\SAMPLE1.SVO

The user can extend and modify OPEN.SYS by any means intended for text files.
