<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText">A matrix to be saved in a matrix file has to be represented in either
of the two forms below:

   11 *    2x3 matrix A without row and column labels:
   12 *MATRIX A ///
   13 * -1.45  2.33 -5.00
   14 *  0.91  3.07  2.28
   15 *
   16 *    2x3 matrix B with row and column labels:
   17 *MATRIX B
   18 *///    Y1   Y2   Y3
   19 * X1  12.2 33.6  6.1
   20 * X2   3.9  0.0 18.7
   21 *

In both cases the line after the last row in the matrix must be left
empty or it has to start with word END.
To save a matrix A located in the edit field, activate
MAT SAVE A
and the first matrix in the current edit field starting with MATRIX A
will be saved in matrix file A.MAT on the current data disk.
To save matrix A in matrix file TEST.MAT, activate
MAT SAVE A TO TEST.
Hence MAT SAVE A is equivalent to MAT SAVE A TO A.

A direct way to save a matrix without a MATRIX label is
   11 *
   12 *MAT SAVE AS A
   13 * -1.45  2.33 -5.00
   14 *  0.91  3.07  2.28
   15 *

Also general and rowwise comments can be given
as shown by the following schematic example:

MATRIX A
This is a general comment 1.
This is a general comment 2.
A
///  C1  C2  C3
R1   11  12  13
R2   21  22  23 / This a comment on line R2.
R3   31  32  33 / This a comment on line R3.
R4   41  42  43

MAT SAVE A / Saving A

If the matrix is loaded by MAT LOAD A, the comments will appear
in their proper places.
This feature is useful especially in result matrices like RG.M
in REGDIAG making the output self-documenting. (See <A HREF="q26_04.html">REGDIAG</A>?:M)

Symbolic constants in matrices
A matrix to be saved from the edit field may also have expressions
of symbolic constants as elements. For example,
   11 *
   12 *   r=sqrt(1/n) n=4
   13 *MATRIX R ///
   14 * 1    r    r^2  r^3
   15 * r    1    r    r^2
   16 * r^2  r    1    r
   17 * r^3  r^2  r    1
   18 *
defines a 4*4 matrix which can saved by MAT SAVE R. Please, note that
R will be saved in numerical form only. If r is altered, MAT SAVE R
must be activated again.
