<P><PRE CLASS="HelpText"><STRONG>Designing forms in FEDIT</STRONG> 

The form definitions are given by the form file. The SURVO 84C editor
can be used to create it (use the SAVEP operation). FEDIT is able
to generate a default form file if all necessary variables are already
defined in the Survo data file. Then you can load (use LOADP) the
created file in the edit field for further editing.

The principle is that the forms are written in the form file as they
should be displayed to the user. The program adds frames around the
form. The fields on forms are denoted in a predetermined way. Besides
the definition of the ordinary form, conditions for displaying the form
as well field checks may be defined. These functions require additional
statements before or after the ordinary form. The structure of the
definitions is the following (obligatory statements are shown by bold
letters):
<STRONG>FORM(the name of the form):</STRONG> 
COND: &lt;conditions for the usage of this form&gt; 
ENCOND;
STRING: &lt;names and lengths of string variables&gt;;
REAL: &lt;names and display lengths of real variables&gt;;
INT: &lt;names and display lengths of integer variables&gt;;
SELECT:
   &lt; definition of variables corresponding each (multi)selection group&gt; 
ENDSELECT;
<STRONG>TEXT:</STRONG> 
      &lt;definition of the ordinary form&gt; 
<STRONG>ENDTEXT;</STRONG> 
RESTR:
      &lt;definition of valid variable values&gt; 
ENDRESTR;
<STRONG>ENDFORM; </STRONG> 

<STRONG>FORM(</STRONG>the name of the next form):
...
<STRONG>ENDFORM;   </STRONG> 
..
<STRONG>ENDOFFILE;</STRONG> 
An example with one form only:

FORM(Flats):
STRING: City(9),Subcity(12),Seller(16),Sauna(1),Type(8),Kitchen(2);
REAL: Area(5), Dist1(5), Dist2(5);
TEXT:

 City: &amp;City
 Subsection: &amp;Subcity
 Type of the flat: &amp;Type      Number of rooms: &amp;Rooms
 Kitchen/Kitchenette (K/KN): &amp;Kitchen
 Sauna (S=yes/E=no): &amp;Sauna
 Area of the flat: &amp;Area
 Selling price: &amp;Price
 Debt: &amp;Debt              Completion year of the flat: &amp;Year
 Seller: &amp;Seller
 Distance from centre of Helsinki to nearest railway station: &amp;Dist1
 Distance from flat to nearest railway station: &amp;Dist2
ENDTEXT;
ENDFORM;
ENDOFFILE;
<STRONG>STRING</STRONG> and <STRONG>REAL</STRONG> statements are necessary only if the Survo data file
does not exist. The maximum length of a field (in characters) is given
in parentheses after the corresponding variable name. The values of va-
riables <EM>Area</EM>, <EM>Dist1</EM> and <EM>Dist2</EM> may have decimals, so they are declared
as real variables. The numbers in parentheses concern the field length
in the form. If the corresponding variable does not exist in the Survo
data file, then it is created as a 4 byte numeric variable. For string
variables, the given lengths are used if the variable is a new one. The
display length of integer variables can be defined by the <STRONG>INT</STRONG> state-
ments in the same way. New integer variables are created as one or
two byte variables depending on the given length.

New variables (not existing in the Survo data file) not mentioned in
STRING, REAL or INT statements are assumed to be integers and two
bytes are reserved for each of them in the Survo data file (however,
if the default display length of an integer variable is defined to be
one by the option INTDEF, then only one byte is reserved). For old
variables,  the information saved in the Survo data file is used  to de-
fine the field length.
The ordinary form is defined by the lines between the key words <STRONG>TEXT</STRONG> 
and <STRONG>ENDTEXT</STRONG>. The left margin of a <EM>standard</EM> <EM>field</EM> is given by the
character &amp; followed by the variable name. The length of the field is
defined by the length of the variable. A one byte numeric variable may
vary between 0 and 254, so a field length of 3 is used for it. Corre-
spondingly for a two byte numeric variable a field length of 6 is used
(values from -32768 to 32766). For real types of numeric variables a
default field of length 7 (4 byte variable) or 14 (8 byte variable) is
used. The field length of a string variable is the maximum length of
the variable defined in the Survo data file if the length is not given
in the STRING statement.
A form with selection fields:

FORM(F3):
STRING: Dmost1(12),Dmost2(12),Dmost3(12);
SELECT:  @F1 3 TO Dmost1,Dmost2,Dmost3;
ENDSELECT;
TEXT:
 3. Which are the three most important export countries for your company?
    Select the countries in the order of importance:

    @F1&lt;Sweden&gt;          @F1&lt;Norway&gt; 
    @F1&lt;Denamrk&gt;         @F1&lt;Germany&gt; 
    @F1&lt;England&gt;         @F1&lt;France&gt; 
    @F1&lt;Russia&gt;          @F1&lt;Italy&gt; 
    @F1&lt;Spain&gt;           @F1&lt;?&gt; 
    @F1&lt;Japan&gt;           @F1&lt;?&gt; 
    @F1&lt;United States&gt;   @F1&lt;?&gt; 

ENDTEXT;
ENDFORM;
ENDOFFILE;

If the form includes <EM>selection</EM> <EM>fields</EM>, then a <STRONG>SELECT</STRONG> statement is
needed to declare the names for the variables, where the selected
values will be saved. The statement starts with a symbol of the
selection group. The symbol must start with the character <STRONG>@</STRONG> and it must
be a short name. A form may involve several groups of selection fields.
Therefore, the groups are identified by a symbol. The name of the
selection group is followed by the number of selections allowed. In the
example, the user may choose 3 countries. The selections are saved in
the order they have been done. The SELECT statement ends with the
key word ENDSELECT.

In the TEXT statement, a selection field starts with the symbol of the
corresponding selection group and the corresponding value to be saved
is given between the characters &lt; and &gt;.   Free selection fields are
given by &lt;?&gt;. The field length of a selection field is defined by the
type of the corresponding variable.
