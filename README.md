# Survo-help
Survo help repository including all the necessary files to create Survo help web page
You can open and activate .EDT files by Survo, which is an R package. 

To recreate Survo web pages you need all EDT-files and /css /fonts /img /media /js
All the html-files are created by Survo-hlp.EDT ACTIVATE command. Each EDT file contains 
only a portion of the full Survo help webpage, but ACTIVATE command will go through all 
required EDT-files.
